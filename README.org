#+TITLE: A quantum interpreter written in Common Lisp

This repository contains my implementation of a small quantum computing
interpreter written in Common Lisp. It is based on the excellent tutorial
by Robert Smith, which you can find [[https://www.stylewarning.com/posts/quantum-interpreter/][here]].

* Pro tip

Use Emacs to explore the source code, you definitely need check out [[https://slime.common-lisp.dev/][Slime]].
